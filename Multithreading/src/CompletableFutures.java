 * Limitations of the Future
 * A Future cannot be mutually complete.
 * We cannot perform further action on a Future's result without blocking.
 * Future has not any exception handling.
 * We cannot combine multiple futures.

 * Future has so many limitations, that's why we have CompletableFuture.
 * CompletableFuture provides a broad set of methods for creating multiple Futures, chaining, and combining.
